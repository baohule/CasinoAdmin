when a user connects to the websocket, we will update the socket sessions list in state
        (redis) so we have a running backend of all the connected users, and their sessions, and their
        games, and their rooms, and their users in the room, and their users in the room's sessions, and their
        users in the room's games, and their users in the room's games' sessions, and their users in the room's
        games' sessions' users, and their users in the room's games' sessions' users' sessions, and their users
        in the room's games' sessions' users' sessions' games, and their users in the room's games' sessions' users'
